DECORATOR PATTERN:

Decorator pattern is a type of structural pattern. 
Decorator pattern allows us to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure. 
This pattern acts as a wrapper to an existing class.

This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality keeping class methods signature intact.
